## Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an advanced artificial intelligence system that specializes in processing, understanding, and generating human-like text. These systems are typically implemented as deep neural networks and are trained on massive amounts of text data.

LLMs achieve an impressive performance boost over previous state-of-the-art NLP models across a wide variety of complex tasks. These include answering questions, performing complex reasoning, and generating coherent, context-aware text, making feasible many new applications.

Before the invention of transformers, the popular approach for modeling sequences involved **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**. In particular, “long short-term memory” (LSTM) and “gated recurrent unit” (GRU) were common architectures.
